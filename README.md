Data Ingestion: NYC Taxi data is ingested using Azure Data Factory (ADF) from an external source into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2).

Data Transformation: Using Azure Databricks with PySpark, the raw data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched.

Data Storage: Final output is stored in Delta Lake format for efficient querying and future use.

This project demonstrates scalable and cloud-native data engineering using modern Azure tools, and is ideal for batch ETL workflows
